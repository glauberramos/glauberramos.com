		<h4>About Me</h4>
		<p>Hi, my name is Glauber Ramos and I'm currently working as UX designer and Front end developer at Thoughtworks in Porto Alegre - Brazil. I love to work in the web where I can constantly learn and share my work, inspiring and being inspired by others. The openness and fast pace characteristics of the web make it an exciting place to be.</p>

		<p>I enjoy working in agile environments where I can design solutions always having in mind the business and the people using the software.</p>
