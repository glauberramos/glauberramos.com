Design Thinking

 twitter DesignThinkers

We have to humanize organisations

design thinkers academy

case-studies are only about outcomes and never about what really matters

thinking fast and slow

fooled by randomness

we learn to do stuff by... doing stuff

its not easy but we all fail and we learn

people have biases and heuristics

value co-creation

only two things that are really really happy

health & happiness

healthcare and happiness is the core of all companies

developing truly human centered health services for people is an wide open and empty space

build a culture of trust to allow people to collaborete in multidisclipnary teams, interact with real customers and build empathy

design thinking enables you to zoom-in and zoom-out

be curious
ask questions
learn to unlearn
DT supports multi-dimensional persons
we are all generalists
DT build emphaty
humnalise companies

business is to create value with people and for people
