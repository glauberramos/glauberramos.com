why ebay is a better prototyping tool than a 3d printer

the long nose, and other tales of history

bill buxton

broken guitar blues - lighthouse

chicken and egg

design -> experience

how can I design someting if I dont have the experience, how can I experience something if I didnt design

rebuild -> test -> rebuild

this is not a pipe

sketch is not a design

I cant do critic on a single thing/piece

what is true in sketching is equally true in usability testing

cant do usability testing on a single product, single thing.

if you expose users to only one design, no rejections
give 3 different things, them you get honest opinions
people like to please, they don't want critique your design

too high subjective ratings

minimal creative input from users

dammit it's hard, do 3 prototyes, three sketches, and test with users

design right and right design, you need both

the long nose of innovation - 20 years


buy products that are similar to the idea you want to build, use them as prototype, learn abou them, you can get to other unpencted ideas you could'nt have got if you used only normal prototyping like 3d printer

psichology 
we are blind to small, fast, change, change blindness

how to avoid problems with redesign, do small changes continuously, dont surprise users, everybody hate your app changing, so change continuously , small and fast.

works, sell, flows, and work together

ecosystem of products, that's a change in everything

the more you need the more you want

instead of adding more nice apps, ice devices

what wiil change is how to add an app that reduces complexity instead of adding just more complexity

3 rules

every new product and service must provide great experience and excellent value

it works and flows

but each must also reduce the complexity and encrease the value of all of the others things work together

rule number 3

every new product service and app must aspire theat reduces complexity of every digital complexecity, reduces the value and every product that you already have increasease the value that everything you bought

car and cellphone connected, like put the cellphone and it turns into a gps

cellphone tells you about the speed and the 
mobile is all around

when you connect 2 devices consistency doe	nst make too much difference, while talking in the car like 100% of the UI changed
