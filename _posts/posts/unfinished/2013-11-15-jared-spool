Jared Spool

Mobie and UX in the eye of the perfect storm

sturgeon's law

theodore sturgeon

why is 90% of all scientic fiction writing crap?

"90% of everything is crap"

90% os websites are crap on mobile phones

case word

first we start by creating technology
than we focus on features, lots of features
too manu features
then we focus on the user experience

we see that over and over again

altavista - features
google - experience

to get from the features stage to experience stage we have to remove features, we have to say no

no is a important thing to say in design

activity vs experience

six flags is activities

display designed for the whole experience, what is beetwen the activities


market maturity

the kano model

performance payoff

basic expectations

excitement generators

google docs - when I say cloud I say in a server in virginia


the eye of the perfect storm

- envest to avoid sturgeon's law
focus an experience over tech and features
fill in beetwen activieis
ensure you meet basic needs while you search for delight

exposure to users is the peniciline of bad design

expose marketing, developers to users
that's the way to prove that more features is not the awnser

frequent user research

lean ux stuff, all about doing that quick, efeectfly and fast
