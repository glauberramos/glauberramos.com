Here are a few things I really like on design/web/interaction
codepen.io : great place to share snippets, like jsfiddle for designers
http://goodui.org is a nice, easy entry point into UX concepts.
fantastic talk bridging design + dev + interaction 
http://css3generator.com  - easy way to make css3 snips
http://www.jqueryscript.net - lots of nice jquery snips
http://alistapart.com - great resource for emerging trends/topics
this guy gives great talks + prezos
Scott McCloud on storytelling, the core of XD/UX.. if there's one book you read this year... don't be fooled that it's a 'comic', this guy is a media genius.

lastly, there was a thread of good pple to follow on twitter re:XD, copied below:
