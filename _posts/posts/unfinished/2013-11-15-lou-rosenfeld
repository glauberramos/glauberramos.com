Lou rosenfeld

seeing the elephant defragmenting user research

barack obama is doing user testing - actual users and focus group

what victory looks like? user research

user rearch in today's organisation

logs form the call center

report from analytics app
insights from voice of the customer research
from crm apps
research center
user mental models from outside company

brand architecture research
net promoter score
so why does everything still suck after all this data collected?

what and why
organizational goals
users goals

measuring the world we know
exploring the world we dont

statistical data
descriptive data

four themes to getting to symtheses

belance 
cadense
conversation
perspective

ban words that impede conversations
- like redesign
- social
