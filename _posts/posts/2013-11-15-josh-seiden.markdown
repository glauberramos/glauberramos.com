User experience in a rapidly changing world
 
NEO

author of lean UX

changing is the new reality 
adapting our practice

old assumptions new reality

old software process based on a manucfacturing process

etsy created continuous integration
50 times a day new softare

facebook deliveres new soft 2 a day
amazon deliveres new soft every 11.6 sec
software enables continuous change

sofware developers learn to be more continuous using agile
designers learn using agile UX
business people learn using lean startup

first to figure out how to be fast is agile software development techies - developers
agile UX - designers
lean startup  - business learn how to be fast
enterprise
sofware is eating the world
every bussines is a software bussiness
every bussiness need to understand how to work continuously

1. continuous learning
2. assumptions & hypotheses
3. small X functional temais
4. enable making
5. manage outcomes
6. a new organisation

continuous learning
internet mouse - the worst thing I ever done

reduce inventory, risk and waste

I have a big idea -------- nope
how long are you gonna wait to learn
a system built on continuous learning
qualitative information
quantitative information
process learing

asumptions and hypotheses
every project start with an assumptions

we called them requirements
not only design assumptions but business assumptions also

we will know this is true when we  see this

small dedicated coloted amd cross-functional team
two-pizza teams
1 project each
1 location(same time zone)
self-sufficient
freedom to experiment

sketching designers and developers doying prototype in real time

bias towards and enable making
cultural bias towards making things
design systems at GE
mvp is the smallest thing you can make to test your hypothesis

what are businesses trying to learn
is there a need / opportunity in the market?
will buy my solution?
does my solution work?

second question is hard to us - to designers

don't design a product, design an experiment
testing an idea early

manage outcomes
output is the thing you make
outcome is that business wants, why are you putting a button?
outuput outcomer 

small team working on product validation and business model validation

we should allow teams to build features that dont work, we need them to fail

deliverable model is an old system and its changing
design only company is a bad idea

i believe a deliverable should be a live system
