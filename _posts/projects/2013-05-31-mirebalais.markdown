<h3>Context</h3>

<span class="alert">The following work is result of work from a team. I was mostly responsible for interaction design, visual design and frontend development.</span>

The hospital provides primary care services to about 185,000 people in Mirebalais and two nearby communities. But patients from a much wider area—all of central Haiti and areas in and around Port-au-Prince—can also receive secondary and tertiary care. The hospital sees as many as 700 patients every day in our ambulatory clinics.

Thoughtworks was called to help build the internal system for the hospital. The challenge involved creating a sofisticated system to keep medical records and other features like patient registration, vitals, dispense medication and x-ray.

The system needed to be intuitive and easy to use, it was going to be used by people from Haiti with low experience with computers.

<h3>Personas and user journeys</h3>

We started creating personas to understand better the type of user was going to use the system.

In order to understand the context of use we started mapping the user journey trought the hospital, creating user journeys for every user we thought was important. The user journey covered offline and online interactions of the users.
